# 🛡️ SafeFlow

**“AI-Powered Stampede Detection & Crowd Safety”**  


## 🚀 Overview

Large gatherings like festivals, rallies, and concerts often face stampede risks.  
Traditional CCTV systems only monitor without predicting, leading to delayed responses and potential loss of life.

It is designed to integrate with AI-powered services that analyze live feeds, predict risk levels, and alert authorities in time.
